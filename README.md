Java Advanced

The "Java Advanced" course examines working with the Java language. In the course we learn to work with linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, as well as create template classes. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - Stream API for processing data streams. The development environment that is used by the training team is IntelliJ Idea 2020.
